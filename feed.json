It was developed within Big Huge Games by Brian Reynolds, the designer of classic PC classics such as Civilization 2 and Alpha Centauri. Rise of Nations was released in May 2003. The game follows a period where many RTS games were being released and gaining popularity, the most notable of which are <a href=\"https://oldgamesdownload.com/age-of-empires-ii-the-conquerors/\">Age of Empires II: The Conquerors</a> and <a href=\"https://oldgamesdownload.com/empire-earth/\">Empire Earth</a>.</p>\n<p>In single-player, players put themselves in the place of leaders of a nation/civization. The player can choose from a selection of many nations, each with their unique military powers and units. Nations can be grouped into four categories: European nations, Asian nations, Islamic nations, and Native American nations. It is also possible to build wonders that have already, in the real world, been built by Man. In standard mode, there are several ways to win: eliminate all enemies, conquer 70% of the map, or build enough wonders of the world. Although Rise of Nations is an innovative game, there are manysimilarities with the Age of Empires series.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://staffprod59/gh-pages2/media/posts/14/Rise_of_Nations_Gameplay_Windows-1.jpg\" alt=\"Rise of Nations\" width=\"1000\" height=\"768\"></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success align-center\"><strong><a href=\"http://festyy.com/w4UBtX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DOWNLOAD</a></strong></p>",

In the game, the player controls a pre-selected nation on a map which includes Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. The time setting is during the transition phase seeing the Roman Republic transform into the Roman Empire. The game mixes turn-based strategy phases, in which the player manages his empire province by province, and phases of tactical battles taking place in real time in a three-dimensional environment. The player controls a Roman faction seeking to extend its domination over the region to found an empire. For this, the player can use military force, but religion, espionage, diplomacy and economy also play a key role in the game.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://staffprod59/gh-pages2/media/posts/13/Rome_Total_War_Gameplay_Windows-1.jpg\" alt=\"Rome: Total War\" width=\"1000\" height=\"768\"></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success align-center\"><strong><a href=\"http://festyy.com/w4UVG7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DOWNLOAD</a></strong></p>",

Each age provides improvements to the civilization, as unlocks various new units, buildings and technologies available for use. In the Imperial Age, which is reminiscent of the early years of the Renaissance, the whole tree of technologies is available for a civilization and the civilization has reached its technological peak. To move from one age to the next, it is necessary to build some buildings and pay certain economic resources.
